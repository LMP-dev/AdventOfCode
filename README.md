# Advent of code
This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com)

## setup.py
Here are the instructions to use setup.py for your advent of code:
- Head over to the website you want to check, right-click anywhere on the website and select "Inspect Element".
- Click on Applications under the Console tab.
- Click on Cookies under the Storage menu.
- Copy the column Value field into a file called the same as the SESSION_ID_FILE constant in setup.py  (in here "session.cookie")

The virtual environment used need the following libraries:
- pip install requests
- pip install Jinja2
